Axon Multi-services
---

:construction: **Attention: under construction** :construction:

Playground application featuring separate microservices communicating via a distributed command bus (Eureka) and a 
distributed event bus (RabbitMQ). Uses Axon framework to demonstrates a way of building a distributed event-driven 
system around the concepts of domain-driven design and CQRS. 

There are several modules, each is a standalone Spring Boot application:

- `common`: module containing configuration (Maven dependencies) common to other modules
- `core`: module with all commands and event shared by other modules
- `db`: H2 file database running as a TCP server
- `eureka`: Eureka server for distributed command bus
- `rabbitmq`: RabbitMQ (running in a Docker image), support for distributed event bus
- `address`: microservice around "address" aggregate
- `person`: microservice around "person" aggregate
- `saga`: Saga implementation of a business transaction (private address assignment)


### Axon configuration

- Using Axon 4.1 version
- Not using Axon Server
- Remove Event Sourcing infrastructure

### API:

Access Swagger UI: at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

### Saga
