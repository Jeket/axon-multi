Axon Multi-services
---

:construction: **Attention: under construction** :construction:

Separate Axon microservices communicating via a distributed command bus (Eureka) and a distributed event bus (RabbitMQ).
No Axon server, no event store, event sourcing is not used.

The idea is to have separate Axon components:

- A microservice on top of `Person` aggregate
- A microservice on top of `Address` aggregate
- A microservice on top of a Saga component which will manage Person/Address assignments

Each component stores its own information only in its own local database (H2).
